      Helicopter Seed isn't defined by a single genre. I believe comics are
      the best medium to tell my stories and share my art, so you can expect
      a variety genres and art styles to appear here.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
