    Helicopter Seed isn't defined by a single genre. I believe comics are
    the best medium to tell my stories and share my art, so you can expect
    a variety genres and art styles to appear here.

      Galvanizing Goldfinch is a superhero story taking place in Seattle. 
      Combining local Native American folklore, Seattle teriyaki, and pulse-pounding
      adventure, this comic is an exciting love-letter to the Pacific Northwest.

      SSS Samara is a science fiction horror story set in a space station on
      the fringes of the galactic frontier. Come for the exciting pioneer lifestyle
      and the fish-out-of-water aliens, stay because the eldritch abomination from
      another dimension won't let you leave!

    The goal is to write compelling, original stories. With genres
    from superheroes to science fiction, I hope to entertain and
    inspire thought on the human condition.
