  - heading: "Writing Comics"
    text: >
      The goal is to write compelling, original stories. With genres
      from superheroes to science fiction, I hope to entertain and
      inspire thought on the human condition.

  - heading: "Drawing Comics"
    text: >
      The goal is to create art with an emotional connection. I'll be
      pencilling, inking, coloring, and lettering all the art myself.
      I hope to find my own style, connect with my readers on an 
      emotional level, and inspire others to do the same.

  - heading: "Learning"
    text: >
      The goal is to learn more about myself and the world around me.
      I hope that getting my ideas down on the page, through story-
      telling and artistic expression, will allow me to explore them
      thoroughly and will lead to deeper connections.
